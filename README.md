# Architectural Laboratory

## Project Overview

This repository contains VHDL implementations of various digital circuits developed during architecture lab sessions. Each session focuses on designing, simulating, and testing different types of logic gates and circuits using VHDL.

## Lab Sessions and Implemented Circuits

### Session 1: Basic Logic Gates and Combinational Circuits

- AND Gate
- OR Gate
- XOR Gate
- Half Adder
- Full Adder

### Session 2: Multiplexers and Decoders

- Priority Encoder 
- 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX4to1)
- Encoder
- 2-to-4 Decoder
- 4-bit Comparator

### Session 3: Sequential Circuits

- D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset (Negative Logic)
- T Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset
- 4-bit Ripple Counter using T Flip-Flop

### Session 4: Multiplexers and Decoders

- 2-to-1 Multiplexer
- 4-to-1 Multiplexer
- 2-to-4 Decoder
- 3-to-8 Decoder

### Session 5: Arithmetic Circuits

- 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder
- carry Look Ahead
- Carry Select Adder

### Session 6: 

- Multiplication ShiftAndAdd

### Session 7: Advanced Combinational Circuits

- Priority Encoder 
- 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX4to1)
- Encoder
